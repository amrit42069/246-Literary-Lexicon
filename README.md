2.4.6 Activity 5
We knew for our project we wanted to do something that would make use of literature in a clever way. So, we came up with the idea of writing a program that rewrites a user’s string input into their selected literary style. This project fit the requirements well because it involved utilizing string methods and iteration for the user input, as well as using outside methods with conditionals for actually changing the string’s writing style. 
E.E Cummings was an iconic modernist poet who was famous for his complete disregard for traditional rules of grammar and syntax, always writing in lowercase and rarely using punctuation conventionally. Our Cummings method takes a user input, makes it lowercase, and removes punctuation. 
Our second method takes the user’s input and rewrites it in archaic English by replacing certain modern words with their Anglo-Saxon counterparts. This method has a lot of limitations, not accounting for the differences in sentence structure between Old and Modern English, and only using a limited amount of replalcement words. Most of our words are personal/reflexive pronouns like:
You (thou)
Your (thy)                 
Yours (thine)
Yourself (thineself) 
Nauseous (wamblecropt)
Liar (snollygoster)
You are such a liar it makes me nauseous. Thou art such a snollygoster it makes me wamblecropt. 
Aside from the predescribed problems with the Old English method, another problem is that our program can only really account for grammatical/syntaxical quirks like writing in all lowercase, while it can’t fully imitate the tone of a specific writer or style, which is like high level stuff. We can make something look like it was written by EE Cummings but we can’t make something feel like it was written by EE Cummings.
